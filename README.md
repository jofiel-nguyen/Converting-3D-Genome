### Python Tool for Converting 3D Genome Contact Matrices to Unweighted Networks

## Project Description:

Recent studies have shown that chromosomes prefer 3D conformations where different loci in the chromosomes come in contact. Such contacts are necessary to bring different regulatory regions of the DNA together for proper genome function. Disturbing these contacts can lead to abnormal cell functions and diseases.

Using molecular technology such as Hi-C experiments, it is possible to determine these contacts in the form of Hi-C matrices. Hi-C matrices represent the chromosome interaction as a weighted graph where the interacting regions are nodes in a graph and the edges, and the interaction edge is given by contact frequency (weight).

Several network algorithms can be applied to study this network to understand and decipher 3D conformations of chromosomes. However, many algorithms require the network to be unweighted. This project aims to develop a tool to convert weighted Hi-C matrices to unweighted networks. We will use simple thresholding algorithms and advanced ones to perform the conversion.

## Features:

- Convert weighted Hi-C matrices to unweighted networks.
- Support for simple thresholding algorithms and advanced conversion methods.
- Easy-to-use Python interface.
- Detailed documentation and examples for usage.

## Usage:

To use the tool, simply provide your weighted Hi-C matrix as input, specify the desired conversion method, and obtain the unweighted network as output.

```python
# Example usage:
from genome_network_converter import convert_to_unweighted_network

# Load Hi-C matrix
hic_matrix = load_hic_matrix("your_hic_matrix.txt")

# Convert to unweighted network
unweighted_network = convert_to_unweighted_network(hic_matrix, method="thresholding")

# Analyze and visualize the unweighted network
analyze_network(unweighted_network)

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the documentation.
```
